A. Vanya and Fence

Vanya and his friends are walking along a fence of height h and they do not want 
the guard to notice them. In order to achieve this the height of each of the 
friends should not exceed h. If the height of some person is greater than h he 
can bend down and then he surely won’t be noticed by the guard. The height of 
the i-th person is equal to a_i.

Consider the width of the person walking as usual to be equal to 1, while the 
width of the bent person is equal to 2. Friends want to talk to each other 
while walking, so they would like to walk in a single row. What is the minimum 
width of the road, such that friends can walk in a row and remain unattended by 
the guard?

Input:
The first line contains two integers n and h (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ h ≤ 1000)
The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2h)

Output:
Print a single integer — the minimum possible valid width of the road.

Example 1:
Input:
3 7
4 5 14
Output:
4

Example 2:
Input:
6 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
Output:
6

Example 3:
Input:
6 5
7 6 8 9 10 5
Output:
11

Explanation:
- Each friend with height ≤ h contributes width 1.
- Each friend with height > h contributes width 2.
