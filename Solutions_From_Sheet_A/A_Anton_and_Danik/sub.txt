A. Anton and Danik

Anton likes to play chess, and so does his friend Danik.

They have played n games in a row. For each game it’s known who was the winner — Anton or Danik. None of the games ended with a tie.

Now Anton wonders who won more games, he or Danik. Help him determine this.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of games.  
The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of letters ‘A’ and ‘D’ — ‘A’ means Anton won that game, ‘D’ means Danik won.

Print "Anton" if Anton won more games.  
Print "Danik" if Danik won more games.  
Print "Friendship" if they won the same number of games.
