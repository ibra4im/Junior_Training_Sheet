# Junior_Training_Sheet
This repository contains my solutions to problems from the Junior Training Sheet V7.0, a structured roadmap for improving competitive programming skills.  I solve the problems in order from the sheet and upload my code here to track progress, improve consistency, and build a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures.
